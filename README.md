## What are Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
Electronic health records are an electronic record of the patient’s previous medical history stored on a computer. Electronic Health Records allow a health provider to quickly, easily, and securely access a specific patients medical records with their permission to allow for faster and more accurate and safe treatment for the patient. Electronic Health Records also include much more information about the patient’s general health, such as previous diagnoses, treatments, test results, and allergies. They are meant to include more information than what is put forward through healthcare providers as well (e.g., a detailed history of the previous clinicians that have been involved with the patient, previous lab tests, or even notes made by the patient themselves about their lifestyle changes.)

A simpler version of an Electronic Health Record would be an Electronic Medical Record. A digitalized copy of the hard documents at a healthcare establishment. EMRs provides clinicians a way to track changing data values overtime, actively monitor vital values, and review local records of a specific patient.

Electronic Health Records are the next step in the digitalization and modernization of healthcare around the world. It makes it easier, faster, and more convenient for both patient and clinicians to record and monitor all the data related to a patient's health, empowering them to make better and more informed decisions for treatments and raising the overall standard of healthcare. 

## Electronic Patient Record (ePA)
An example for an Electronic Health Record system is the German electronic patient record (ePA) system. Everyone covered by health insurance in Germany can voluntarily and freely make use of the electronic patient record (ePA) system with fine control on who has access to their records and for how long they’re allowed to access it.

For ease of access, health insurance providers offer the insurance holders a free app for their smartphones to access their electronic patient records. The ePA system can be used to store personal health information such as lab test results, previous diagnoses, and confirmed or recommended medical treatments. Through the ePA system you can also access digitalized copies of various medical documents such as Vaccination certificates, maternity records, child examination booklets, and dental bonus booklets. All of this is available only through the explicit consent of the patient of having this information recorded.

Security when it comes to information as sensitive as medical health records is always important. That is why as a patient you have ultimate control on who accesses your private information and for how long. All of this can be managed through the ePA app on your smartphone or on-site at the medical care establishment using the electronic medical data card and personalized PIN. The ePA system is also completely end-to-end encrypted, so not even your health insurance provider can access it without your permission.

Opting into the ePA system is as simple as contacting your health insurance provider and requesting to be registered on the electronic patient record system. It is free to everyone with statutory or private health insurance. The health insurance provider will then forward to you all the detailed information needed to finalize your registration through the ePA app on your smartphone or if you do not want to use the application yourself, you can authorize your assigned doctor to finish the registration process for you. And even when changing health insurance providers, ePA can be transferred easily through a few clicks.



## Other commonly used EHR/EMR systems
Epic is one the most used EMR systems at the moment. It offers a cloud-based EMR solution for many specialties that is easy integrate into any healthcare establishment normal workflow while offering all the basic expected features of an EMR system. Due to this it is widely used in the US. 

Other popular EMR/EHR systems include Cerner, and MEDITECH. All following this chart:

## What are the benefits of Electronic Health Records?
-  It provides a safe and secure way to store and retrieve all the relevant medical and health related information of a patient quickly to the medical staff when they need it the most. Information coming from a properly implemented electronic health system will lead to a much faster and accurate diagnoses and treatment plan for the patient.
-  With an electronic record of all of the patient's previous tests, consultations, and treatments - the doctors will be able to avoid any repeat tests and wasted time during doctor's appointments and wasted lab time and equipment allowing for an increase in overall healthcare capacity from the time saved.
- Avoiding the many disadvantages of the previous paper-based records system. Those disadvantages depending on the implementation range from the space used by the physical records at every establishment and the man-power needed to maintain it and keep it organized, to such minor details such as poor writing or forgotten details such as the time given, or notes to correct errors (e.g., wrong dose, drug, form, etc.) when dealing with such a large quantity of written documents. Such errors can be prevented very easily through simple steps on a digital platform, such as auto-recording timestamps and requiring for specific crucial information to be properly documented before submitting changes.



## Are EHR/EMR systems the future of patient health records?
They are definitely the future of the health industry, but without proper implementation, it could fail. The biggest concern when it comes to EHR systems is the security of the personal and very confidential records of the patients. Many leaks and breaches of EHR/EMR services in the past have proven to be very damaging to all individuals involved. They also severely lower trust in digitalized systems such as EHRs and how safe they are to protect the patients information. But with implementations such as the ePA in Germany using end-to-end encryption and being completely voluntary this future may be realized.
